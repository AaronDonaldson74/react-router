## React Router:
<!-- - Inside your react folder -->
<!-- - use npx create-react-app react-router -->
### React Router Goal: 
<!-- - The website should have a navigation of Home, About, Contact, and Blog -->
<!-- - Using react-router-dom make sure all the routes go to each indivual page -->
<!-- - For instance if I click on About it should take me to localhost:3000/about and render the About component -->
### React Router Hints:
- https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start
<!-- - Create a navigation.js file -->
<!-- - Create a home about, contact and blog file -->
<!-- - You will need BrowserRouter, Route, Switch, and NavLink for this to all work correctly -->
### React Router Extra Credit:
- Style the active class
- Create a no-match component to be a catch all for routes that don't exist
- Create a slug-detail component and make it render the slug url
- Inside your home component make it render a Link that will render a slug-detail component
